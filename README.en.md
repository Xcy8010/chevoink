## 🤖 Chevoink Agent 3.0

Agent 3.0 is a stateful creative agent that keeps working with one novel rather than a one-shot prompt generator. It identifies the task and story phase, loads two or three relevant Skills on demand, builds a cacheable Research Dossier when research is justified, and uses the Story Compiler to turn reader promises, character desires, obstacles, choices, costs, and state transitions into a scene task. Continuity and human-quality checks run before a revision-guarded atomic write, ChangeSet, and durable event stream commit the result to the workspace.

The deterministic evaluation suite freezes 24 Chinese web-fiction scenarios across six genres, nine task classes, and twelve quality signals. CI stores a report carrying the dataset hash, code SHA, model, and Skill version. Automated metrics diagnose regressions; they do not replace real author outcomes or anonymous review by at least three target-genre readers/editors.

## 📥 Download & Install (Android App)

Pick either channel:

1. **GitHub Releases (recommended)**
   - Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/Xcy8010/chevoink/releases) and enter the latest version (e.g. `v1.50`);
   - Download `chevoink-vX.XX.apk` from the Assets section;
   - Tap to install. If the system warns about "unknown sources", allow "install anyway" in the dialog (the APK is signed with the release key).
2. **Direct download from the official site**
   - Visit <https://chevoink.chevolink.com/download/chevoink.apk> in a mobile browser and install directly.

No manual upgrades needed afterwards: the app checks for new versions on launch, and the in-app banner / settings page will prompt and guide the update. Web users always get the latest version by opening the live site.

## 📖 User Guide

### Readers

1. **Sign in**: phone number + SMS verification code — no registration flow; the account is created on first login;
2. **Find books**: the bookstore home offers carousels, rankings and category recommendations, plus title/author search;
3. **Read**: page-flip navigation inside the reader; tap the center to summon the menu for font size, typeface, paper theme and flip mode; reading progress and bookshelf sync to the cloud, so you can continue on another device;
4. **Listen**: enable TTS narration in the reader, with selectable voices and speeds; flip mode shows a bottom playback capsule;
5. **Interact**: comment, like and bookmark on the book detail page; post, join topics, follow authors and chat in the community.

### Authors

1. Enter the **Studio** and start talking to Chevoink Agent immediately. With no existing work, randomized creation examples appear; selecting one only fills the composer, and after the first send the Agent turns the hidden bootstrap workspace into a real novel through the scope-checked, atomic `novel_create` action. A new empty task inside an existing novel also receives four randomized building prompts;
2. Write directly in the chapter editor or invoke **Chevoink Agent 3.0**. It streams drafts and revisions grounded in your project knowledge, builds a genre Research Dossier only when needed, and uses Story Charter, Reader Promise, Scene Task, and Chapter Bridge to preserve long-form causality and continuity. Post-write quality findings always include source-text evidence;
3. Manage Skill OS 3.0 in the **Work Skills** area on Work, IDE, or mobile. Built-ins route automatically; authors or the Agent can draft private Skills, which must pass positive/negative trigger tests before publication. Every version can be pinned, disabled, and rolled back. Shared installation requires author confirmation, while third-party source imports must declare a licence, attribution, and immutable version;
4. Attach **images (≤6) and files (≤3, pdf/docx/txt/md)** to the prompt. Multimodal models receive image pixels directly, while text-only models automatically use the safe vision sidecar; files are always read before action. Conversation files are clickable, and long contents are collapsed by default;
5. Generate cover art with one click via **AI cover generation** (remote URLs are automatically persisted to the site); you can also ask the Agent to "look at the current cover" to verify the artwork;
6. **One-click export**: launch it from the immersive-mode toolbar, the "…" more menu or the mobile "More" sheet; pick the export scope (plans / catalog / chapters / work info & publishing advice, with per-chapter selection), and the server packs a zip for direct download, including AI-generated publishing advice for Fanqie Novel based on its official tag vocabulary; you can also ask the Agent in chat to export on demand (only certain chapters, or excluding specific parts);
7. Open the **Agent Operations Center** from the Agent header to search, pin, or archive tasks across novels; fork a novel version from the current chapter/run snapshot and compare or merge it; launch budgeted/cancellable research, continuity, quality, and lore subagents with trace replay; configure durable inspections, server-enforced tool sandboxes, and 2–4-run comparisons across model tier, reasoning, tokens, and latency;
8. Publish finished chapters — readers see them instantly; scheduled updates and chapter management are supported.

### Public-beta Credits

- Public-beta accounts receive **450 Credits per day**, resetting at **15:00 UTC+8**. Referral rewards live in a separate balance and survive daily resets.
- Text uses a bundled allowance: **1 Credit includes both 10,000 input tokens and 1,000 output tokens**. Charging uses the larger utilization ratio instead of adding input and output charges. Image generation costs 6 Credits per invocation and web search costs 2 Credits per invocation.
- Every user gets a unique referral URL. Only a brand-new account can redeem it on first registration: the inviter receives 300 Credits and the invitee receives 120 Credits; each invitee can redeem exactly once.
- Studio warns at 20%, 10%, and 5% remaining. Exhaustion safely stops the task; [`/account/usage`](/account/usage) shows the plan, balances, and itemized ledger.
- The Agent defaults to the Speed tier (1.0x) with high reasoning. Each built-in or custom model exposes only its supported effort levels. Standard 1.1x, Performance 1.8x, and Ultimate 4.8x remain unavailable until an administrator fully configures their URL, API key, and model. Authors may also use an OpenAI-compatible BYOK model; its key is encrypted and never revealed again.

## ✨ Feature Overview

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment variables (see .env.example; fill in DB connection, AI keys, etc.)
copy .env.example .env   # or: cp .env.example .env on Unix

# 3. Initialize the database
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
npm run prisma:seed   # optional: seed data

# 4. Start development (Vite frontend + nodemon backend in parallel)
npm run dev
```

Common scripts:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Frontend + backend parallel development |
| `npm run check` | TypeScript type check |
| `npm run test` | Run tests (Vitest) |
| `npx vitest run --coverage` | Run tests with local/CI dual-baseline coverage gates |
| `npm run agent3:eval` | Emit a versioned Agent 3.0 deterministic eval snapshot with hashes and code SHA |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint check |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run deploy:prod` | One-click deploy to the production server |

## 📦 Deployment & Releases

- **Production deploy**: `npm run deploy:prod` (local gates: type check → tests → production-dependency security audit → build; then package & upload → remote migrate/build → PM2 reload → health check)
- **Push to GitHub**: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\push-to-github.ps1`, supports `-Tag v1.50 -ReleaseAsset <apk path>` to tag and publish a Release (with the Android APK attached)
- **Android APK**: built by the separate Capacitor shell project, distributed via the in-app update banner / settings-page update check

## 🔐 Environment Variables

All secrets are injected via `.env` (database, session signing, Tencent Cloud SMS, AI services, etc.); the template is at [.env.example](.env.example). Model API keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. Production must use a dedicated `MODEL_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; back it up and rotate it deliberately, because losing it makes stored keys undecryptable. Sensitive files such as `.env`, certificates and keystores are excluded by `.gitignore` and never enter the repository.

## 🙏 Special Thanks

Chevoink is independently designed and implemented. The following open-source projects provided important references during the evolution of Agent 3.0, the novel domain model, and the Studio experience:

| Open-source project | Referenced area in Chevoink | What we learned from it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | Writing Agent Loop, Work mode, task/tool execution, context organization | Agent-first workflows, traceable tool calls, continuous long-running tasks, context compaction, restrained workspace hierarchy, and collapsible sidebars |
| [OpenFic](https://github.com/syrizelink/OpenFic) | IDE mode, work tree, volume/chapter structure, novel retrieval, and writing Skills | Novel-focused IDE information architecture, the `Volume → Chapter` domain model, persisted panel layouts, chapter retrieval flows, and open-ended writing capabilities |
| [TencentDB Agent Memory](https://github.com/TencentCloud/TencentDB-Agent-Memory) | Long-form Agent story memory, character relationships, events, and conflict review | Layered memory, provenance and revision tracking, hybrid retrieval, memory updates, and conflict-governance patterns |
| [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) | Reasoning and tool-activity UI in Work / IDE | Progressive disclosure of reasoning, execution-state communication, and compact visual hierarchy for tool-call history |
| [React Flow / xyflow](https://github.com/xyflow/xyflow) | Story-memory relationship graph | Chevoink directly uses `@xyflow/react` for viewport panning, zooming, fit-to-view, controls, and minimap navigation |

These projects primarily informed architecture research, product interaction, and engineering principles. Except for third-party software explicitly declared in the dependency manifests, Chevoink's business code is redesigned and implemented for its own stack and novel-writing use cases. Our sincere thanks go to their maintainers and contributors for advancing the open-source Agent and creative-tool ecosystem.
